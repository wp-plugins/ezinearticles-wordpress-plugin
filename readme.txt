== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I have the plugin installed, how do I submit to EzineArticles? =

When you add or edit a post, you will see a box labeled "WP EzineArticles" in it. It contains the additional fields required to submit to EzineArticles. Make sure they are filled out and then push the validate button.  Fix any errors that appear and when you are ready push the submit button.

= How can I resubmit an old post as an article on EzineArticles? =

You can edit a post, set your EzineArticles settings, and then "Validate" and "Submit".  If you do press "Publish", it will update your WordPress post.

= I can't see any categories. =

Try refreshing the page. Categories are now pulled from EzineArticles rather than stored locally, and it may need to refresh.

= The plugin hangs when trying to contact =

Your firewall may be dropping outgoing requests between your webserver and api.ezinearticles.com.  When you install the plugin it will display an error if the server could not be contacted.

= The plugin triggered an error =

First check your php version. PHP version 4.3 or above is required, with newer being better.  If that is up to date, see if you can figure out what the error was by looking at the log for your webserver.  Any feedback on bugs will help us develop the next version.

= Wordpress MU =

Multiuser WordPress is not compatable with this plugin.

= I am unable to upload the plugin to Dreamhost =

You are not be able to upload the plugin to Dreamhost if you cannot write to the wp-content/plugins folder.  
The basic 'easy mode' setup does not allow this because Dreamhost does not give you the correct permission to do so.
If you setup in 'advanced mode', you will be able to write to your plugins folder, and should be able to install custom plugins.
